                <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
                <p class="lead-paragraph">Bio Shield Repellent was born from a simple yet powerful mission: to create effective pest protection that's safe for families and kind to the environment. Founded in 2020 by a team of passionate scientists and outdoor enthusiasts, we recognized the need for natural alternatives to harsh chemical repellents.</p>
                
                <p>Our journey began when our founder's young daughter developed sensitive skin reactions to traditional bug sprays during a family camping trip. Determined to find a better solution, we spent years researching and developing natural formulations that deliver professional-grade protection without compromising on safety.</p>

                <p>Today, Bio Shield Repellent stands as a trusted name in natural pest protection, serving thousands of families who refuse to choose between effectiveness and safety. Every product we create undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets our high standards for both performance and environmental responsibility.</p>
